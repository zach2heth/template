Unfortunately, I don’t know everything. Frequently, I run into problems while learning a new language or programming tool, and am not sure why. It could be syntactic, or I might be ignorant to an underlying concept I haven’t heard of. In either case, I usually end up asking a classmate, or looking at Stack Overflow [include link] to see if anyone has had a similar problem. I’ve found that the more specific a question is, the more likely it is to get a clear and direct answer. Broad questions tend to be met with attempts to specify such as “What do you mean?” and, “Assuming that you mean [blank]…” 

Erin Raymond created an excellent post about asking smart questions, and how to get more out of others. Here is a link [] for those interested. Some of the points he brings up are to show that you’ve made an effort to answer your own question, be precise about what you’ve done so far, don’t be presumptuous, and make your goal clear. 

On Stack Overflow, there are some questions far more developed and well formulated than others. As a result, the user usually received the type of answer s/he was looking for. On the other hand, there are plenty of questions that are not worth taking a second glance at. I’ll show you two examples below and explain how the quality of the question may have affected the responses. 
 In [this example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27296278/minesweeper-c?rq=1), the user Cerberus has three questions about a Minesweeper program s/he wants to create. The first question is about the rules of the game. This is something that can be easily researched, and does not require outside help. The second question is whether anything should be displayed when there are zero adjacent mines. S/he states that the goal is to make it as close to the Windows version as possible. It’s good that was specified, but s/he says that s/he plays Minesweeper on Windows 7. In that case, why can’t s/he answer the question on their own? 

The last part states that s/he does not understand the logic behind the recursive mechanic where multiple squares are revealed at once. S/he then asks when this feature needs to be used. This again shows that Cerberus did not take the time to do any outside research, or give much thought of their own before asking this question. 
The post ends with “Currently I know only C++. What do I need to learn to be able to make the game interactive?”  What does s/he mean by interactive? It’s such a vague statement that there’s no way to begin to answer without asking Cerberus more questions.
 
The post received two responses. They are both short and directly answer the questions that Cerberus posed, without bothering to elaborate. The post itself was closed by moderators for being too broad. Overall, the question received poor feedback.

In this [next example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/931257/how-can-i-find-the-data-structure-that-represents-mine-layout-of-minesweeper-in/1177402#1177402), the user KingNestor is trying to learn about reverse engineering, using minesweeper as an example. He (I’m assuming he is a male because, well, they are a King after all) starts off by saying he tried to look at an old article online, while providing the link, but that it was not helpful. KingNestor then states what programs he’s using. He then states his question, “Can someone provide some practical tips for either of these programs in terms of finding the location of the data structure that represents the mind field?” It’s very clear what he’s looking for. He then goes on to talk about some of the trouble he’s been having, which is not necessary, but still helps to further describe the type of problem he’s having. He ends by asking to be pointed in the right direction. 

The post received ten responses, one of which was very lengthy with a lot of detail. A lot of the other responses were references to look into, or ideas that others had. KingNestor made his goal of leaning about reverse engineering clear. He stated what resources he had, and what he was trying to do. As a result, he got a few great answers.  

Now it’s obvious I’ve cherry-picked examples to fit the theme of this essay. However, it helps to illustrate the point of asking good questions. One thing that’s interesting are the post lengths. Both examples were about the same size. However, the quality of the responses were completely different. 

Fortunately, I don’t need to know everything. People are kind, and willing to help those who seek it. But if I’m ever asking a classmate or professor a question, I’ll be sure I’ve done my own research first. People are busy, and have every right to turn me away. If I show that I’ve put in the work and am serious about learning, they’re more likely to sympathize. If I’m concise, precise, and ask smart questions, I’m more likely to get the answers I need.
