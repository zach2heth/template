Before college, I had no experience coding. I had no idea what programming entailed, and wasn’t sure what I was getting myself into. I didn’t want to start my first semester as a computer science major behind all of my classmates, who I assumed would be intelligent computer geniuses. I knew I would be taking a Java class and thought I should start learning it. I found free, interactive tutorials on Code Academy (add link), and saw the Javascript track. I figured it was probably the same thing as Java, and tried it out.

Two years later and looking back, I now know that Javascript and Java, are in fact, two completely different languages. They are both functional languages, and so the same type of logic can be applied to both. However, Javascript is much less technical and intimidating to learn. Variable data types don’t need to be defined, and arrays can hold multiple types of data. Trying to implement a data structure with that capability in Java would be monstrous challenge (unless there’s something like that in the API that I just don’t know about). 

But probably the best thing about Javascript is printing to the console. 

System.out.print vs console.log

That’s a 5 character-input difference! Considering how frequently I like to print things for testing, that will add up quick.
Although that doesn’t quite beat C++ with cout

Relearning Javascript in my software engineering class, ICS 314, has been a slightly nostalgic programming trip. I understand it a lot more, and have even picked up on some new things. There are built in functions that allow arrays to act as either a stack, queue, or a combination of the two. It’s interesting, being able to add properties to objects during run time. That’s a very exciting idea to me, and if I have the time (and motivation), I might play around with that feature on my own. I think Javascript is a great language to be learning in class because of how relatively easy the concepts are to grasp. When working with others, the focus will be on the problem we are trying to solve, rather than on understanding the language itself. 

ICS 314 has been a fun class so far. The professor is very passionate, and is implementing his idea, “Athletic Software Engineering (ASE),” where the assignments and in class quizzes are a “Workout of the Day (WOD).” The underlying idea is that we practice coding (or whatever the topic is) frequently, and that the grade we get for each WOD is either all or nothing. Furthermore, in class WODs have a strict time limit that must be met. I like this concept because programs and deadlines have a relatively binary nature. Either they do exactly what you want them to do, or they don’t. Either you meet the deadline for a project or you don’t. I’m looking forward to the WODs this semester and learning more Java. I mean, Javascript.
