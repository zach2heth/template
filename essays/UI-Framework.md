<h2>**Disclaimer** I suck at web design</h2>
Until two weeks ago, I knew almost nothing about HTML, CSS, and web design. To be honest, I still barely know anything.

However, for the past week, I have been practicing recreating the visual aspects of different websites, like [Club Penguin](https://clubpenguinrewritten.pw/), using Semantic UI. [What I've been able to make](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/zach2heth/clubpenguin/blob/gh-pages/clubpenguin/index.html) is not nearly as clean, but it's not a bad start.

<h2>What is a User Interface Framework</h2>

UI Frameworks provide classes that can be used for CSS styling. They often come with an API for looking up what those classes do. The benefit is that the user does not have to spend a lot of time writing their own CSS. They simply invoke the prewritten classes to modify their HTML elements. Those classes can be overwritten and changed by the user, but it provides a general base for creating common objects and visual designs you might find on a webpage.

<h2>What is Semantic UI</h2>

[Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) is a specific UI Framework. What really sets it apart from other UI Frameworks (or at least, this is what the Semantic UI people claim) is their natural language class names. The class names are extremely intuitive, which means if you were to forget the name of a class, you can take a guess based on what it's function is.
Here is something that happened somewhat often while I was working with it.

"Hmmm, how do I make a button that's large and red? I'll just try.."

```
<div class="ui large red button">...</div>
```
<div class="ui large red button">...</div>


"Wow it worked!"

Since the keywords to remember are obvious, it makes learning the terminology relatively easy.
It provides things like different types of menus, icons, search-bars, and much-much more.

<h2>I do not like web design</h2>

I know it's only been two weeks, but I do not like designing webpages.
I do not enjoy working on little visual details like exact spacing between objects, or perfect text alignment. Semantic UI made it easier but it was still slightly frustrating. I spent about three hours, watching tutorial videos on how to use several of their classes. When I started trying to make a webpage, I had to refer to examples very frequently. But after a while, I got tired of looking up examples of how to use the classes in a way which would solve my problems. Instead, I wanted to add padding, or adjust the margins directly. However, I undertand a lot of that work gets thrown out the window when viewing it on a different platform such as a smartphone. Semantic UI is able to deal with that cross-platform formating so I don't have to.  

It's very possible that I don't appreciate how powerful Semantic UI, or any UI Framework, is because I haven't spent countless hours trying to make a webpage without a framework's assistance. I can't even begin to imagine how I would create a menu, or any of the visual effects that Semantic UI provides.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Probably the best thing about Semantic UI will be remembering how to use it in the future. For me, with every developer tool and programming language, it's "use it or lose it." Syntax always takes a bit of time to relearn. But I would imagine I will not have that problem with Semantic UI.

I don't know if I'll learn other UI Frameworks in the future, but I don't think I'll want to if they're filled with a bunch of complicated class names. I do not plan on being a web designer, but if a situation were to ever arise where those soft skills are needed, Semantic UI will be the way to go.
