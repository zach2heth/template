The first problem I had with Meteor was installing it. It would not intall properly, and gave me some ways I could fix it. Each method involved something about pathways, and using sudo. I don't understand much about scripts, or the command line and so this made very little sense to me. I had to look into and learn about sudo and such to try and fix it. I still was not able to, and Professor Johnson had to help me by adding a pathway to be searched when trying to run commands. As someone just getting into Meteor, this was an unfriendly welcome.

Meteor itself is confusing. There are several files in several folders, that all have a different purpose. In order to test HTML or Javascript code on the website, the appropriate files need to be imported in either the client-side, server-side, or both. While working on a digits WOD, I forgot to import my contacts.js file. I did not look at the webpage until I finished the code, and so I was not sure why nothing was showing up. I had checked several of the different client and server side files with the import statements and it looked exactly like Professor Johnson's files. I had to look up an outside tutorial to finally figure out what I had done wrong. I honestly do not remember what I did to fix the issue because I didn't really understand the solution.

Even after completing half of the digits wods, I don't feel like I understand much about Meteor. I don't even understand what it is that I don't understand.
