<h2>Software Engineering Ethics</h2>


<h3>What are "ethics"</h3>

Ethics are the morale issues surrounding a particular issue, and how someone should proceed to handle a given situation. An important part of ethics is knowing who or what is at stake in a given scenario. For example, it could be the loss of life, money for a company, or maybe privacy of an individual. Comparing what is at stake and deciding what is more important is the primary concern of an ethical dilemma. To say whether or not an action is ethical, is to decide if it is morally acceptable behavior. That is subject to each individual's perception of the world, and philosophy. However, there can still be a general consensus for a particular issue.

<h3>What does "ethics" mean for a developer?</h3>

It may be difficult to grasp how lines of code can affect the surrounding world. However, society is becoming increasingly integrated with technology. It is clear that the code comprising cultural necessities, such as smartphones, is something to take seriously. A software engineer has a moral obligation to consider the potential affects of their code, and how to minimize negative consequences. If those consequences cannot be resolved, they must determine if the project itself is ethical.

Software engineers must still be professional in their work. If they choose to take on a project, they owe it to their client to finish it. However, they may still bring up concerns as they arise. A software engineer cannot turn a blind eye to the ethical problems associated with their decisions, as it will have lasting effects on those who use their products, and the surrounding communities.


<h3>User Protection and Privacy</h3>

Let's talk about ethics in regards to keeping user information safe, and respecting the privacy of a user. Are software engineers responsible for confidentiality of user information, and how far does that go?

<h4>Protecting User Information</h4>

Let's say there an online chat room hosted on a website. The users are required to create a login name and password. To what extent does the developer of the website need to go to ensure that information is not accessible? The passwords should be hashed at a minimum to prevent password storage in plain text, but how secure does it need to be? There's no way to tell if a login name is real or fake. Nor is there any email address to associate an account with. We would obviously not want anyone to be able to access the associated usernames and passwords. However, it would still be ethical to use a less secure hashing algorithm because the information is not vital. It cannot be easily used to trace a real person to an account. What about the team maintaining the web server? Should they be allowed to see user passwords that have been hashed? Is that unethical? I would say that is a shady thing to allow. It casts doubt on the team's credibility, especially if there an ongoing problem with hacked accounts.

<h4>Respecting User Privacy</h4>

To what extent do the chat rooms themselves need to be monitored, and at what point is it a breach of privacy? If users reveal personal information about themselves, is that the problem of the software engineers? What if they reveal personal information about another user? The only way to tell for sure would be to read the contents of a chat. In this case, where users have complete control over how much they reveal about themselves, it would make sense to make it clear to the users the risk they put themselves at by doing so. However, if one user reveals the information of another, there should be an easy way to report it. To check for harassment, or discussion illegal activity, a word filter could be implemented to warn a moderator. This would then give them permission to view the conversation. It is more ethical to breach the privacy of a conversation and check for harmful activity, than it is to host an online chat where this sort of conduct is allowed without. However it also begs the question of what words should be put into that filter, and how those words would be decided upon.


If the client asking for the website doesn't specify anything about privacy, then it would be at the best judgement of the software engineer. It becomes their responsibility to ensure user information is kept as private as possible. Furthermore, they ought to let the client know of their concerns about user privacy, and explain the very real problems that can occur if its not taken seriously. If that information cannot be kept private, then the developers credibility will be called into question. Who would want to hire a software engineer who's work can't protect against data breaches?


What if the client is specifically asking for something that puts the privacy of the user at risk, or violates the user's privacy? This sort of job should be thought about carefully, before being accepted. There is no correct amount of acceptable risk. In general though, the more sensitive the collected information is, the more careful of a system the client should be asking for. Software the violate user privacy is not black and white either. If it's for the protection of society at large, then I think it is still ethical to a certain extent. As long as that information is used only for its intended purpose it's fine. Once that information is used for unintended purposes, or for things that do not benefit the people who's privacy is being violated, does it become unethical.

<h3>Ethics is Important</h3>

By default, software engineers ought to protect the user's information and privacy as much as possible. It becomes increasingly important when the user is required to give personally identifiable information. Information breaches cause real damage to people's lives. No matter the project, a software engineer should consider the consequences of the software they produce. If they choose to ignore the ethics side of being a developer, they are putting others at unnecessary risk. It's like selling someone a car without a working parking break. In most scenarios, when someone parks their car, shifting the gear into park is enough. The driver will never know their parking break doesn't work. But the one time the driver decides to park on a steep hill, they may come back to find their car totalled at the bottom. It requires a certain level of empathy and awareness to actively think about the ethical dilemmas surrounding a project. However it is absolutely necessary for the protection of the people who put their trust in a software engineer's product.
