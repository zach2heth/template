The problem: Students are unsure if they have enough time to commute between their classes based on their schedule. Sometimes they are forced to try it out on their own to see how long it takes. Using Google Maps is not an option, because they do not have information about the campus buildings.

The solution: <b>Can I make it (CIMI)</b> is an application which gives the time it takes to walk between two locations on campus. Allowing them to create schedule that is feasible.

The student will enter their tentative schedule, and the app will tell the user if they are unable to make the commute between any of their classes.

The student will log in to save their tentative schedules, and average commute times between locations.

If a student wants to know how long it takes to commute between two locations, they can select the two points on the map, and it will give an estmated commute time.

As the app gains popularity, the app will use actual data to create more accurate estimates.
